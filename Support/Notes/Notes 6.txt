Communicating With Peers
- IP address, DNS, routing, ISP, gateway, devices
- router assigning IP addresses
- PC lots of apps communicating with the internet
- port numbers
- We will specify the specific port number for the crypto wallet
- TCP/IP - protocols for communicating data (Transmision Control Protocol -
handles the packets of data and ensuring arrive, integrity). There are different
protocols, and confirms delivery.
- IP handles the routing, the right location through servers.

Client / Server
- how socket communication works
- a software object we use for internet communication is a socket
- stores information necessary to communicate between 2 devices, facilitate
- Server/client model
- server listens for connection from a client (can be a simple echo server)
- Server needs a socket, bind to an IP address and port number), then set the 
server socket to listen, until a client conncets, accepts it, and receives the 
data, and can send back data. 
- When the server accepts the connection, it creates a new socket so it can
receive and send.

- client side creates the socket, and connects to an IP address/port number. Simpler.

- The server socket sees a match, and accepts. 
- After operating full, the client then closes.
