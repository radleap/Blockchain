Transactions

Create a transaction class 
Transfer of coins from one public address to another
Will sign and verify transactions 
Teach transactions to verify self, and test
- In the blockchain transaction ledger, your public key is your
address, how others identify you in the blockchain ledger.
- When coins are sent to your public address, the only way to get them out 
is to use your private key to sign a transaction to send them somewhere else.
- So when coins are sent to you, they are reserved to a public record
in such a way the only way to transfer is to sign a transaction using your
private key. 
-A person may have many addresses, and long as you keep record then no problem.

Multiple output addresses
-transactions will store two lists, one for inputs and one for outputs.
- to be valid will require a signature for each of the input addresses.
Reasons:
- better anonimty to use different addresses for each transaction
- if someone wants to track your spending, then is harder

Multi-signature Transactions
- Coins should not move from an address without a transaction signed 
by the corresponding private key
- ability to require multiple signatures
- everytime there is a coin moving via transaction, need a signature from the 
private key that corresponds to that address.
- require a signature from someone that doesn't require any coins - can be useful
- consider the scenario of coin for goods. How to make sure either doesn't cheat each
other.
- Use a third party for an escrow transaction
- Before good sent, a transaction can be released by the third party. The third party
can only sign. party one will sign a transaction sending funds to 2nd party, but only
valid from an additional signature from the third party. If 2nd doesn't deliver goods,
then 3rd party not sign.
