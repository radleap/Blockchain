Digital Signature
easy to verify
Asymetric encryption
-RSA
-2 keys public, and private
-When someone wants to send a message only read by you. 
-Buy from visa, internet not secure, so the vendor sends their public key
-You use the public key to encrypt a message, and those are sent via the internet
-Vendor using the private key can turn it back into a number.
-If intercepted, w/o the private key can not decrpyt.
Digital Signature
- owner of a private key to sign a message, same alorithm as above, use the
- now share and a recipient can use the public key to encrypt the message, 
- and get out the original message. And know you are the one to sign the message
- The message we want to sign could be long, and we want a fixed length signature
- We perform all on a hash of the message, hash function, which makes it shorter.
- hash functions are the basic of a blockchain
- makes a fingerprint of that message
Crypto Connection
- we are signing entries in a public ledger.
- send 10 keys to A, I use my private key to sign it too recipient A.
- A wants to spend, and in order to spend needs to prove own it.
- So using the digital signature
- can post verifiable statements to a public ledger

Test Driven Development
Write a test of the new functionalitty (which fails)
- interface, and tests that only pass if it accomplishes what we want
- our plan
- write tests and our plan
